    <h1>Three Things About Me</h1>
      <ol>
        <li><h3>I'm a Detroit Native</h3><br />
          <p>Despite what my funny accent might suggest,
           I was actually born at Henry Ford Hospital and lived here
           until I went off to university.</p></li><br />
        <li><h3>My Favourite Philosopher Is Actually a Poet</h3><br />
          <blockquote cite="http://writersalmanac.publicradio.org/index.php?date=2011/07/04">
            <p>This is what you shall do; Love the earth and sun and the animals, despise riches
              , give alms to every one that asks, stand up for the stupid and crazy, devote your
              income and labor to others, hate tyrants, argue not concerning God, have patience
               and indulgence toward the people, take off your hat to nothing known or unknown
               or to any man or number of men, go freely with powerful uneducated persons
                and with the young and with the mothers of families, read these leaves in
                 the open air every season of every year of your life, re-examine all you
                  have been told at school or church or in any book, dismiss whatever insults
                  your own soul, and your very flesh shall be a great poem and have the richest
                   fluency not only in its words but in the silent lines of its lips and face and
                    between the lashes of your eyes and in every motion and joint of your body.</p></blockquote><br />
            <p> -Walt Whitman, <cite>Leaves of Grass</cite>.</p></li><br />
